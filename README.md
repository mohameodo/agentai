To unlock features like auth, file uploads, agents, and background removal, see [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md).

## CodeHat Workspace

CodeHat generates files and runs commands inside a local workspace.
By default the workspace root is the project directory, but you can
override it with the `WORKSPACE_ROOT` environment variable:

```bash
WORKSPACE_ROOT=/path/to/workspace npm run dev
```

All projects are saved under `codehat-projects` inside this workspace
and the interactive terminal operates from that directory.

- **Multiple Models**: Choose from 9+ high-quality image models (FLUX.1 Schnell, SDXL Lightning, Ideogram v2, etc.)
- **Daily Limits**: 5 free image generations per day for all users
- **Inline Results**: Generated images appear directly in your chat conversation
- **Model Selection**: Configure your preferred image model in Settings → General → Model Preferences

### Supported Models
- **FLUX.1 Schnell** - Ultra-fast, exceptional quality (default)
- **SDXL Lightning** - Lightning-fast 1024px images

- **Smart Integration**: Appears automatically when you upload images (if enabled)

### How to Use

#### Enable Background Removal
1. Go to **Settings** → **General** → **Model Preferences**
2. Toggle **Background Removal** to **ON** (marked as Beta)
3. The feature will now appear when you upload images

#### Process Images
1. **Upload an Image**: Click the **+** button or drag and drop images into chat
2. **Remove Background**: Click the **"Remove BG"** button that appears below image uploads
3. **Download**: The processed image will automatically download to your device

#### Supported Formats

### Database Setup
If you're self-hosting, run the background removal schema:

```sql
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor or database
-- See BACKGROUND_REMOVAL_SCHEMA.sql for the complete setup
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS user_preferences (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  background_removal_enabled BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  -- ... other columns
);
```

### Troubleshooting
- **Slow Processing**: Try smaller images (< 2MB) for faster results
- **Poor Quality**: Works best with clear subject-background separation
- **Browser Issues**: Requires modern browser with WebAssembly support
- **Memory Errors**: Close other tabs if processing fails on large images
